# my_blog
A blog covering my coding journey

1.20.2019

Today I'm going to start learning Ruby. I bought the book: "Learn to Program" by Chris Pine. I'll start with that. I also have a course on Udemy as well, I'll do that in between. I mainly got that because it covers some big projects with Rails, which I intend to use. My intent in doing this is A: documentation. A way to keep myself on track. I'll eventually build a blog site to host this on as well. It is also B: to post my goals and, hopefully, keep myself accountable. I'm probably not going to post this on twitter, or do the 100 days of code thing. But, I will blog regularly about what I'm doing.
