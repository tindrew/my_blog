# my_blog
A blog covering my coding journey

1.20.2019

Today I'm going to start learning Ruby. I bought the book: "Learn to Program" by Chris Pine. I'll start with that. I also have a course on Udemy as well, I'll do that in between. I mainly got that because it covers some big projects with Rails, which I intend to use. My intent in doing this is A: documentation. A way to keep myself on track. I'll eventually build a blog site to host this on as well. It is also B: to post my goals and, hopefully, keep myself accountable. I'm probably not going to post this on twitter, or do the 100 days of code thing. But, I will blog regularly about what I'm doing. I'm also going to set a time frame for myself.

2 months. 
In 2 months, I want to have my course done, and finish 2 books.
By March 20th

Books:
Learn to Program by Chris Pine
Learn Ruby the Hard Way by Zed Shaw

Courses:
The Complete Ruby on Rails Development Course on Udemy

These are the three main things I want to finish within two months.
I will attempt to keep track of the amount of hours spent on a per day basis, but it may not be completely accurate every day. I have a full time job, a wife, a 3 year old son and 2 dogs that take a good bit out of my time.
