A blog covering my coding journey


Today I'm going to start learning Ruby. I bought the book: "Learn to Program" by Chris Pine. I'll start with that. I also have a course on Udemy as well, I'll do that in between. I mainly got that because it covers some big projects with Rails, which I intend to use. My intent in doing this is A: documentation. A way to keep myself on track. I'll eventually build a blog site to host this on as well. It is also B: to post my goals and, hopefully, keep myself accountable. I'm probably not going to post this on twitter, or do the 100 days of code thing. But, I will blog regularly about what I'm doing. I'm also going to set a time frame for myself.

2 months. 
In 2 months, I want to have my course done, and finish 2 books.
By March 20th

Books:
Learn to Program by Chris Pine
Learn Ruby the Hard Way by Zed Shaw

Courses:
The Complete Ruby on Rails Development Course on Udemy

These are the three main things I want to finish within two months.
I will attempt to keep track of the amount of hours spent on a per day basis, but it may not be completely accurate every day. I have a full time job, a wife, a 3 year old son and 2 dogs that take a good bit out of my time.

I spent most of the day setting up the coding environment. I had windows 8, and since Ruby doesn't run natively on Windows, I had to upgrade to Windows 10 to be able to use a new feature in Windows, the ability to install a Linux terminal so I could then install Ruby and Rails and use the command line. After that, I installed and configured Atom, and started my Ruby Course.

I coded for about 3 hours. I made it through the beginning of the Udemy course, mainly covering things like writing to console, using irb to run ruby directly in the terminal, and getting comfortable with some of the new syntax such as puts and writing strings. Also did some basic maths.

Today I programmed for about 5 hours. I worked on Learn to Program, covering some of the basics up to methods. Then I switched over to my Udemy course and worked on some more. I'm finding that it's better to have at least 1 book and a course going at the same time. It gives me more practice, more examples, which should (in theory) make me better since I will be getting more hands on. My mission is to not copy paste any code, but instead to type every line, every bracket, every letter and number. That way I will develop muscle memory faster than if I copy and paste most of the code.

What I"m really liking about Ruby so far, is it's not as verbose as JavaScript (That's an understatement, nothing is as verbose as that language lol). So far I like what I see. It is definitely much more readable, and there is nowhere near the brackets, semicolons, etc etc that JavaScript has. I'm looking forward to digging in and seeing what this language has to offer.
