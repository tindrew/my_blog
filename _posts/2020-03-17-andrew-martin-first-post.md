Hello, Thanks for stopping by. I post regularly on dev.to and I want to continue that, but I'd like to post some things that aren't directly dev related, so I'll post those here along with adding all my dev.to posts also, just so I have everything in one place. Feel free to drop me a <a href="mailto:drew@andevr.dev">line<a/> and say hello, or hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/Andevrs">twitter</a>.
